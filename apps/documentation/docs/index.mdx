You can write PlantUML code directly inside of code blocks. The rendered diagram will show up
immediately after the code block default. For example, if I write the codeblock:

````markdown
```plantuml
@startuml
A -> B:"Hello"
@enduml
```
````

it is rendered thusly:

```plantuml
@startuml
A -> B:"Hello"
@enduml
```

It's also possible to refer to external diagram files with the `.puml` suffix as if they were
images, and they'll be rendered directly into the document. So that I can write:
`![hello](./hello.puml)` (referring to a hello.puml file in the same directory as my markdown), and
it will show up like this:

![hello](./hello.puml)
